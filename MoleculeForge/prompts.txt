A selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor targeting chronic inflammatory diseases with improved metabolic stability.
The molecule should:
1. Directly bind to the NLRP3 protein (not targeting ASC or caspase-1)
2. Block inflammasome assembly without affecting other innate immune pathways
3. Show high potency (IC50<100nM) in inhibiting IL-1β and IL-18 release
4. Feature a structure that avoids reactive intermediates or covalent binding
5. Have balanced physicochemical properties for oral dosing (LogP 2-4, 3-6 rotatable bonds)
6. Demonstrate CNS exclusion to minimize central side effects (low BBB penetration)
7. Show efficacy in models of inflammatory diseases (e.g., NASH, inflammatory bowel disease)




An orally available, small-molecule positive allosteric modulator of the GLP-1 receptor for type 2 diabetes.
The molecule should:
1. Bind to the allosteric site of GLP-1R, not competing with the endogenous peptide
2. Enhance the activity of endogenous GLP-1 without activating the receptor alone
3. Have excellent oral bioavailability (F>30%)
4. Show minimal risk of hypoglycemia due to glucose-dependent mechanism
5. Incorporate features that increase residence time at the receptor
6. Maintain metabolic stability with minimal CYP450 inhibition
7. Have suitable physicochemical properties (MW<500, LogP 1.5-3.5, TPSA 75-140)


A potent and selective MCL-1 inhibitor for treating multiple myeloma, overcoming resistance to BCL-2 inhibitors.
The molecule should:
1. Feature a structure capable of binding to the BH3-binding groove of MCL-1
2. Demonstrate selectivity for MCL-1 over BCL-2 and BCL-XL (at least 10-fold)
3. Include conformationally-restricted scaffolds to improve binding affinity
4. Have drug-like properties suitable for oral administration (MW<550, HBD≤3)
5. Incorporate solubilizing groups to overcome the high lipophilicity typical of this class
6. Show metabolic stability with t1/2 >4 hours in human liver microsomes



A dual-acting SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitor for improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes with reduced GI side effects.
The molecule should:
1. Contain a C-aryl glucoside core structure
2. Balance inhibition of both SGLT1 (intestinal) and SGLT2 (renal) transporters
3. Include modifications that reduce intestinal SGLT1 inhibition to minimize diarrhea risk
4. Have moderate lipophilicity (LogP 2.0-3.0) for optimal absorption
5. Show high renal excretion to target kidney SGLT2
6. Maintain glucose-lowering efficacy while minimizing hypoglycemia risk


A brain-penetrant HDAC inhibitor with selectivity for HDAC6, suitable for neurodegenerative disease treatment.
The molecule should:
1. Contain a zinc-binding group (hydroxamic acid or similar)
2. Include a linker region with optimal length for HDAC6 binding
3. Have a cap group that provides selectivity over other HDAC isoforms
4. Possess good blood-brain barrier penetration (low MW, few H-bond donors)
5. Maintain high metabolic stability to enable once-daily dosing
6. Have LogP between 2.0-3.5 and TPSA under 90 Å²
