DEBUG: Generating 3 molecules from description: A brain-penetrant HDAC inhibitor with selectivity for HDAC6, suitable for neurodegenerative disease treatment.
The molecule should:
1. Contain a zinc-binding group (hydroxamic acid or similar)
2. Include a linker region with optimal length for HDAC6 binding
3. Have a cap group that provides selectivity over other HDAC isoforms
4. Possess good blood-brain barrier penetration (low MW, few H-bond donors)
5. Maintain high metabolic stability to enable once-daily dosing
6. Have LogP between 2.0-3.5 and TPSA under 90 Å²
